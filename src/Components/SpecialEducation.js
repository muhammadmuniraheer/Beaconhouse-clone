                        <h3>Vision</h3>
                        <span>Beaconhouse values its heritage while it continues to reinvent its
                             educational approach to meet the needs of the future. We believe that
                              modern methods and attitudes can enable students to achieve their fullest potential
                            With the world and the needs of the community changing at an ever-increasing rate,
                             Beaconhouse endeavours to be open to change, to adapt, innovate and keep pace with
                              the goals that society expects. At Beaconhouse, our aim and belief is that through
                               effort and hard work, students will be able to step confidently into the highly
                                competitive ‘real world’. We ensure that they are equipped with the ability to
                                 make mature and well-informed judgements based on a clear understanding of 
                                 essential principles, concepts and moral values. This, we believe, is the
                                  best contribution we can make towards their development as productive 
                                  members of society and, through them, to the country and the wider world.</span>

                        <span>The Beaconhouse group has over 315,000 fulltime students in eight countries
                             and is possibly the largest school network of its kind in the world. Established 
                             in November 1975 as the Les Anges Montessori Academy with 19 toddlers, Beaconhouse
                              has since grown into an international network of private schools, 
                              imparting distinctive and meaningful learning to students all the way from birth 
                              – through its partnership in Pakistan with Gymboree Play & Music
                               – to post-graduation, through Concordia Colleges and the Beaconhouse National 
                               University.
                            Of these students, over 111,200 study at the group’s flagship network,
                             the Beaconhouse School System, while the remaining are largely enrolled 
                             at The Educators, a parallel school network operated by the group with 
                             over 200,000 students. Other students are in Beaconhouse schools overseas.
                            The Beaconhouse of today is thus much more than just a stand-alone school. 
                            Through distinct and independent divisions across multiple destinations including Malaysia,
                             Thailand, the Philippines, Oman, the UAE, Pakistan and Belgium, it caters to the 
                             education and training needs of a large and diverse group of individuals of varying ages,
                              socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities, with its activities also extending beyond
                               education in some countries.</span>

                        <span>Mrs Nasreen Mahmud Kasuri has played a pivotal role in women’s 
                            empowerment in the country.  Sixty-two per cent of Beaconhouse employees are women,
                             with a very high percentage in upper management.  Mrs Kasuri is the Chairperson of 
                             Beaconhouse which she founded in 1975.
                            Mrs Kasuri has served on the Boards of many government
                             and non-government organisations. Actively involved in a number of non-profit and charity
                              organisations, she received the ‘Sitara-e-Eisaar’ from the Government of Pakistan in 
                              2006 for her philanthropic and humanitarian contributions. She is currently also 
                              Chairperson of Pakistan’s first liberal arts university, the non-profit Beaconhouse 
                              National University.
                            In September 2012, Mrs Kasuri received the Woman Power 100 award 
                            in London. Pakistan Power 100 is an event that honours the
                             achievements and contributions of influential men and women
                              from within the international Pakistani community, and recognises
                               the positive impact they have had on a local, national and
