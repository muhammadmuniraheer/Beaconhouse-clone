                    <p>
                        School of Tomorrow (SOT) events started in the year 2000 as a
                        free-to-public event series organised by Beaconhouse as part
                        of its ongoing commitment to social responsibility.
                        Over the years, the series has featured hundreds of activists,
                        cultural leaders, educators, futurists, thinkers, along with three
                        prime ministers and presidents and other trailblazers from across
                        Pakistan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia,
                        New Zealand, Malaysia, India and many other countries.

                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                    <span>Beaconhouse values its heritage while it continues to reinvent its
                        educational approach to meet the needs of the future. We believe that
                        modern methods and attitudes can enable students to achieve their fullest potential
                        With the world and the needs of the community changing at an ever-increasing rate,
                        Beaconhouse endeavours to be open to change, to adapt, innovate and keep pace with
                        the goals that society expects. At Beaconhouse, our aim and belief is that through
                        effort and hard work, students will be able to step confidently into the highly
                        competitive ‘real world’. We ensure that they are equipped with the ability to
                        make mature and well-informed judgements based on a clear understanding of
                        essential principles, concepts and moral values. This, we believe, is the
                        best contribution we can make towards their development as productive
                        members of society and, through them, to the country and the wider world.</span>

                    <h3>Background and History</h3>
                    <span>The Beaconhouse group has over 315,000 fulltime students in eight countries
                        and is possibly the largest school network of its kind in the world. Established
                        in November 1975 as the Les Anges Montessori Academy with 19 toddlers, Beaconhouse
                        has since grown into an international network of private schools,
                        imparting distinctive and meaningful learning to students all the way from birth
                        – through its partnership in Pakistan with Gymboree Play & Music
                        – to post-graduation, through Concordia Colleges and the Beaconhouse National
                        University.
                        Of these students, over 111,200 study at the group’s flagship network,
                        the Beaconhouse School System, while the remaining are largely enrolled
                        at The Educators, a parallel school network operated by the group with
                        over 200,000 students. Other students are in Beaconhouse schools overseas.
                        The Beaconhouse of today is thus much more than just a stand-alone school.
                        Through distinct and independent divisions across multiple destinations including Malaysia,
                        Thailand, the Philippines, Oman, the UAE, Pakistan and Belgium, it caters to the
                        education and training needs of a large and diverse group of individuals of varying ages,
                        socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities, with its activities also extending beyond
                        education in some countries.</span>

                    <h3>Chairperson’s Profile</h3>
                    <span>Mrs Nasreen Mahmud Kasuri has played a pivotal role in women’s
                        empowerment in the country.  Sixty-two per cent of Beaconhouse employees are women,
                        with a very high percentage in upper management.  Mrs Kasuri is the Chairperson of
                        Beaconhouse which she founded in 1975.
                        Mrs Kasuri has served on the Boards of many government
                        and non-government organisations. Actively involved in a number of non-profit and charity
                        organisations, she received the ‘Sitara-e-Eisaar’ from the Government of Pakistan in
                        2006 for her philanthropic and humanitarian contributions. She is currently also
                        Chairperson of Pakistan’s first liberal arts university, the non-profit Beaconhouse
                        National University.
                        In September 2012, Mrs Kasuri received the Woman Power 100 award
                        in London. Pakistan Power 100 is an event that honours the
                        achievements and contributions of influential men and women
                        from within the international Pakistani community, and recognises
                        the positive impact they have had on a local, national and
                        international level.</span>
